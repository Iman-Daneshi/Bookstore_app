This is a bookstore app. It benefits from a customised authentication system using Allauth third-party app. users can't see list of books nor search them unless they regiseter in the site and sign in. I aslo used Crispy-forms to format pages.The whole project was dockerized and successfully deployed in Heroku host. a superuser can give some users special permissions using ORM. The bookstore website can also send conformation email to the console while a user is registering.
